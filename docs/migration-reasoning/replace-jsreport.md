### Current State

The Insurance Hub system currently relies on JSReports, an external service for PDF generation that
operates as a separate component requiring independent deployment, scaling, and monitoring. This
creates additional operational overhead and introduces network latency for document generation
requests. The system maintains HTTP-based communication with JSReports for rendering insurance
documents, statements, and reports, which adds complexity to the overall architecture and creates
potential points of failure in the document generation pipeline.

### Why chromedp is the Right Choice

1. **Architectural Simplification**

- Eliminates the need for the external JSReports service, reducing the number of components to
  deploy, scale, monitor, and maintain
- Reduces operational complexity and infrastructure costs by consolidating PDF generation into the
  application layer
- Removes external service dependencies and potential network failure points from the document
  generation process

2. **High Fidelity Rendering**

- Leverages Chrome's Blink rendering engine for exceptionally high-quality PDF output with full
  support for modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- Existing HTML templates are likely to work with minimal to no changes, reducing migration effort
- Provides consistent, browser-grade rendering that matches what users see in web interfaces

3. **Self-Contained Service Architecture**

- Replaces JSReports with a single, self-contained Go binary that includes all necessary PDF
  generation capabilities
- Eliminates external runtime dependencies for PDF generation (only requires Chrome/Chromium
  executable in the same container)
- Aligns with the target state's goal of simplified, cloud-native service architecture

4. **Performance and Efficiency**

- Removes network latency from HTTP calls to external JSReports service, enabling faster document
  generation
- Reduces resource usage by eliminating the need to maintain a separate service instance
- Enables better resource utilization through direct in-process document generation

5. **Cloud-Native Integration**

- Fits seamlessly into containerized deployment with Chrome headless running in the same container
- Supports horizontal scaling as part of the Go microservice without additional service coordination
- Integrates naturally with Kubernetes resource management and observability tools

This approach transforms PDF generation from an external service dependency into a native capability
of the Go microservices, supporting both the migration goals and the cloud-native architecture
principles.
