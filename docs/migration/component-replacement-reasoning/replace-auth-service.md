### Current State

The `auth-service` existing is a custom implementation built with Micronaut Security that handles
basic authentication functionality:

- Simple username/password authentication against a database
- JWT token generation and validation
- Basic user profile management (login, avatar, product codes)
- Custom authentication provider logic

### Why Keycloak is the Right Choice

1. **Security and Compliance**

- Keycloak is a mature, battle-tested identity and access management solution with extensive
  security auditing
- Regular security updates and patches from Red Hat and the open-source community
- Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Comprehensive audit logging and compliance features

2. **Cloud-Native Architecture Alignment**

- Designed specifically for containerized, microservices environments
- Native Kubernetes support with official operators and Helm charts
- Follows 12-factor app principles with externalized configuration
- Horizontal scaling capabilities that align with the target Kubernetes-first deployment model

3. **Feature Richness Beyond Current Capabilities**

- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support out of the box
- Multifactor authentication (MFA) capabilities
- Social login integration (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple applications
- User federation with LDAP/Active Directory
- Fine-grained authorization policies and role-based access control (RBAC)

4. **Operational Simplicity**

- Eliminates the need to maintain custom authentication logic
- Reduces security-related development overhead
- Provides admin UI for user management, reducing operational burden
- Standard protocols mean easier integration with third-party tools and services

5. **Technology Stack Compatibility**

- Keycloak integrates seamlessly with Go microservices through standard JWT token validation
- Compatible with gRPC and REST APIs through standard Authorization headers
- Supports the target observability stack (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus metrics)
- Can be deployed alongside other cloud-native components in Kubernetes

6. **Migration Path Alignment**

- Replacing a custom Java service with a standard solution reduces the overall migration complexity
- Allows the team to focus Go development efforts on core business logic rather than authentication
  infrastructure
- Supports the strategic goal of leveraging proven, maintained solutions over custom implementations

7. **Scalability and Performance**

- Built for high-availability deployments with clustering support
- Optimized for performance in distributed systems
- Caching mechanisms for token validation to reduce a database load
- Supports the target system's scalability requirements
