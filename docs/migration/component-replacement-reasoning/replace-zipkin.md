## Current State

The Insurance Hub system currently relies on Zipkin for distributed tracing, providing basic request
tracking across microservices with limited correlation capabilities and manual trace analysis
requirements. The current implementation offers minimal context propagation between services,
requires custom instrumentation code for each integration, and lacks standardized observability
protocols. Trace data analysis is fragmented, with no unified correlation between traces, logs, and
metrics, making comprehensive root cause analysis difficult during incidents. The Zipkin-based
approach operates in isolation from other observability components, creating operational overhead
and preventing holistic system visibility essential for managing complex distributed architectures.

## Why OpenTelemetry + Tempo is the Right Choice

1. **Industry-Standard Observability Protocol**

- OpenTelemetry represents the vendor-agnostic observability framework adopted by major cloud
  providers, eliminating vendor lock-in through consistent APIs and SDKs
- Provides comprehensive Go instrumentation libraries with automatic context propagation across gRPC
  and HTTP calls
- Offers future-proof observability infrastructure that integrates with any compliant backend system

2. **Unified Grafana Ecosystem Integration**

- Seamlessly integrates with the target Grafana-based observability stack, enabling unified
  correlation between traces, logs, and metrics
- Creates a single observability data model within Grafana's interface, eliminating the operational
  complexity of managing separate tools
- OpenTelemetry SDK automatically correlates trace data with structured logs through shared
  identifiers

3. **Cloud-Native Architecture and Performance**

- Tempo's object storage backend (MinIO) aligns with the cloud-native storage strategy, providing
  infinite scalability for trace data
- Eliminates performance overhead of traditional database-backed tracing systems through efficient
  sampling and batching
- Operates as a stateless, Kubernetes-native service that scales horizontally with the microservices
  architecture

4. **Comprehensive Context and Developer Experience**

- Enables rich trace context including business metadata, custom tags, and detailed service
  interaction mapping
- Provides automatic instrumentation for database queries, external API calls, and inter-service
  communication
- Reduces instrumentation complexity through automatic discovery and minimal configuration overhead

This approach transforms distributed tracing from a basic, isolated monitoring tool into a
comprehensive, integrated observability foundation that provides deep system visibility and supports
the operational requirements of a cloud-native distributed architecture.
