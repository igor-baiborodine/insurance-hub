### **Migration Strategy: Insurance Hub to Go and Kubernetes**

This strategy follows an iterative approach, ensuring that each phase delivers value and builds a
stable foundation for the next, minimizing risk throughout the process.

#### **Phase 1: Foundational Infrastructure & Environment Migration (Lift and Shift)**

**Goal:** Move the existing Java application to a Kubernetes environment with minimal code changes.
This validates the new platform and de-risks subsequent, more complex changes.

1. **Provision Kubernetes Cluster:** Set up a production-ready Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Deploy Core Infrastructure:**
    * Deploy **PostgreSQL**, **Elasticsearch**, and **Apache Kafka** to the Kubernetes cluster.
    * Deploy **MinIO** as the new S3-compatible object storage solution, which will replace the
      existing file system storage.
3. **Targeted Code Modification (Java):**
    * As you noted, this step is unavoidable. Modify the existing Java services (e.g.,
      `document-service`) that interact with the file system. Update them to use an S3-compatible
      SDK pointed at the new MinIO service endpoint.
4. **Containerize and Deploy Java Services:**
    * Create production-grade container images for all Java microservices.
    * Deploy these services to Kubernetes.
    * **Replace Consul:** As per the analysis in `replace-consul.md`, decommission Consul and switch
      to Kubernetes-native service discovery. This is primarily a configuration change in the
      Micronaut services to use Kubernetes' internal DNS for service-to-service communication.
5. **Deploy Existing Gateway:** Deploy the current Java-based `agent-portal-gateway` to Kubernetes
   and configure it to use the new K8s service discovery mechanism to route traffic to the backend
   services.

**Outcome:** The entire Java application is now running in the target Kubernetes environment. All
dependencies are containerized, and object storage is handled by MinIO. The system is functional,
providing a stable baseline for the next phases.

#### **Phase 2: Modernize Observability**

**Goal:** Implement a comprehensive, cloud-native observability stack to gain deep visibility into
the application's behavior on Kubernetes. This is critical for monitoring the health and performance
of the system during the migration.

1. **Deploy the Observability Stack:**
    * **Metrics:** Set up **Prometheus** for metrics collection and **Grafana** for visualization.
    * **Logging:** Set up **Loki** for centralized, queryable log aggregation.
    * **Tracing:** Set up **Grafana Tempo** to replace the existing Zipkin/Jaeger setup for
      distributed tracing.
2. **Instrument Java Services:**
    * Update all Java services to integrate with the new stack. This will require code
      modifications.
    * Reconfigure services to output structured (JSON) logs to standard output.
    * Replace Zipkin instrumentation with the **OpenTelemetry SDK**, configured to export metrics to
      Prometheus and traces to Tempo.
3. **Build Dashboards and Alerts:** Create initial Grafana dashboards to monitor key application and
   infrastructure metrics. Configure essential alerts to enable proactive issue detection.

**Outcome:** A robust, centralized observability platform is in place. You now have the necessary
tools to monitor, debug, and safely manage the subsequent migration phases.

#### **Phase 3: Data Store Consolidation**

**Goal:** Simplify the data layer by migrating product data from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, thereby
reducing operational complexity and unifying the persistence strategy.

1. **Adapt Database Schema:** Modify the PostgreSQL schema to accommodate the data currently stored
   in MongoDB. As recommended in `replace-mongodb.md`, use the `JSONB` data type to store flexible
   insurance product definitions.
2. **Develop and Test Migration Scripts:** Create scripts to perform the ETL (Extract, Transform,
   Load) process from MongoDB to the new PostgreSQL tables. Thoroughly validate the data integrity
   post-migration in a staging environment.
3. **Update `product-service`:** Refactor the data access layer of the Java `product-service` to
   communicate with PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB.
4. **Execute Migration:** Schedule and perform the data migration. After a final validation, switch
   the `product-service` to use the new PostgreSQL database.
5. **Decommission MongoDB:** Once the system is stable and the migration is confirmed successful,
   decommission the MongoDB instance.

**Outcome:** The system's data persistence is consolidated onto PostgreSQL, simplifying operations,
backups, and data governance.

#### **Phase 4: Phased Service Migration to Go (Strangler Fig Pattern)**

**Goal:** Gradually and safely replace the Java microservices with new, efficient Go microservices.

1. **Establish Go Development Standards:** Define project structure, idiomatic coding practices, and
   standard libraries for logging, configuration, and OpenTelemetry instrumentation for all new Go
   services.
2. **Rewrite, Deploy, and Shift Traffic:** Apply the Strangler Fig Pattern on a per-service basis:
    * **Select a Service:** Start with a lower-risk service (e.g., `chat-service`).
    * **Rewrite in Go:** Develop the new Go service, implementing its API with **gRPC** as specified
      in the target architecture.
    * **Deploy:** Deploy the new Go service into Kubernetes alongside its Java counterpart.
    * **Shift Traffic:** Configure the routing layer (the Java gateway for now) to direct a small
      fraction of traffic to the new Go service.
    * **Monitor:** Use the observability stack from Phase 2 to closely monitor the new service for
      errors and performance issues.
    * **Increment and Decommission:** Gradually increase traffic to the Go service. Once it handles
      100% of the traffic reliably, decommission and remove the old Java service.
3. **Repeat:** Continue this process for the remaining services (`policy-service`,
   `payment-service`, etc.), prioritizing based on business needs and technical dependencies.

**Outcome:** The core business logic is progressively migrated to a modern, performant, and scalable
Go-based microservices architecture.

#### **Phase 5: Modernize Edge and Authentication**

**Goal:** Replace the custom Java gateway and authentication service with powerful,
industry-standard, cloud-native solutions. This phase can run in parallel with Phase 4.

1. **Replace `auth-service` with Keycloak:**
    * Deploy and configure Keycloak in Kubernetes.
    * Migrate user data and authentication logic to Keycloak.
    * Update frontends and all backend services (both Go and any remaining Java services) to use
      Keycloak for authentication via standard OIDC/OAuth2 protocols.
    * Decommission the custom Java `auth-service`, as justified in `replace-auth-service.md`.
2. **Replace `agent-portal-gateway` with Envoy Proxy:**
    * Deploy Envoy Proxy as the new ingress gateway.
    * Configure Envoy to manage all incoming traffic, handle TLS termination, and perform routing.
    * Use Envoy's advanced capabilities to translate external REST API calls into internal gRPC
      calls for the new Go services.
    * Integrate Envoy with Keycloak for JWT validation at the edge.
    * Once all traffic is managed by Envoy, decommission the old Java `agent-portal-gateway`.

**Outcome:** The system is fronted by a secure, highly performant, and feature-rich edge and
identity management stack, aligned with cloud-native best practices.

#### **Phase 6: Post-Migration Hardening and Optimization**

**Goal:** Solidify the new architecture, automate processes, and optimize for performance, security,
and cost.

1. **Implement GitOps:** Automate CI/CD pipelines for the Go services using a GitOps tool like
   ArgoCD or Flux for declarative, version-controlled deployments.
2. **Advanced Kubernetes Management:**
    * Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) to automatically scale services.
    * Enforce Kubernetes Network Policies to create a zero-trust network environment.
    * Fine-tune resource requests and limits for all services to maximize cluster efficiency and
      stability.
3. **Complete Legacy System Replacements:**
    * **Tariff Rules:** Migrate the file-based tariff rules to **Tarantool** for scalable, in-memory
      execution.
    * **PDF Generation:** Replace the JSReports dependency with a new Go service utilizing the
      `chromedp` library for headless Chrome-based PDF generation.
4. **Continuous Improvement:**
    * Use the rich data from the observability stack to continuously identify performance
      bottlenecks and optimize resource usage.
    * Ensure all new architecture and processes are thoroughly documented.
    * Archive or remove all repositories and artifacts from the old system.

**Final Outcome:** A fully modernized, scalable, observable, and secure Insurance Hub platform,
built on a future-proof Go and Kubernetes foundation that is simple to operate and ready for future
innovation.
