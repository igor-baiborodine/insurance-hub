Certainly! Here is a reasoning-only evaluation on whether the should be replaced by Keycloak, based
on your system overview and migration analysis: `auth-service`
Keycloak is a mature, open-source identity and access management solution that is widely adopted in
cloud-native environments. Cloud-native platforms benefit from standard, centralized, and extensible
auth providers because authentication and authorization are critical non-functional concerns with
significant security, compliance, and operational ramifications.
Replacing a custom with Keycloak brings several clear advantages: `auth-service`

- **Standardization:** Keycloak implements open protocols (OIDC, OAuth 2.0, SAML) accepted by
  cloud-native stacks and modern client platforms. This reduces the need to custom-build or maintain
  protocol support.
- **Security:** Centralizing authentication logic in a battle-tested project like Keycloak lowers
  the risk of vulnerabilities compared to maintaining bespoke code.
- **Feature Depth:** Keycloak provides advanced identity features—multi-factor authentication,
  social login, identity federation, user self-service—out-of-the-box. Implementing these in-house
  is costly and risky.
- **Extensibility:** Cloud-native systems require rapid adaptation to new requirements (e.g.,
  integrating external IdPs, changing token formats, adding custom user flows). Keycloak is designed
  for this extensibility.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Operating a custom authentication service creates a maintenance and
  testing burden. Operator support, backup routines, patching, monitoring, cluster scaling, and
  upgrades are all more robust and less resource-intensive with a mainstream solution.
- **Cloud-Native Integration:** Keycloak offers first-class support for Kubernetes deployments,
  supports dynamic configuration, secrets integration, and is compatible with modern observability
  tooling.

Given the system’s migration to Go, standardized containers, Kubernetes-native principles, and a
desire for robust, composable security and zero-trust patterns, using Keycloak for authentication
and authorization aligns tightly with cloud-native best practices. It allows developer teams to
focus on business logic while offloading significant security responsibility and complexity to a
proven, widely supported platform.
**Conclusion:**
Replacing a custom with Keycloak is justified by its conformance to cloud-native security,
operational, and agility requirements, and it is the preferred path for reducing risk and technical
debt in a modernized architecture. `auth-service`

<summary>Reasoning for replacing auth-service with Keycloak</summary>

Yes, replacing the custom `auth-service` with a dedicated, off-the-shelf Identity and Access
Management (IAM) solution like Keycloak is the standard and highly recommended best practice for a
modern, cloud-native architecture. The reasoning is as follows:

* **Reduces Development and Maintenance Burden:** Building, and more importantly, maintaining a
  secure, robust, and feature-rich authentication service is a significant undertaking. Using
  Keycloak frees the development team from reinventing the wheel and allows them to focus on the
  core business logic of the Insurance Hub. The complexities of password policies, token management,
  and security patching are handled by a dedicated, battle-tested system.

* **Comprehensive, Standard-Based Feature Set:** Keycloak provides a vast array of features
  out-of-the-box that would be time-consuming and difficult to implement correctly in a custom
  service. This includes:
    * **OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0:** Industry-standard protocols for authentication and
      authorization that ensure interoperability.
    * **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Centralized login across multiple applications and services.
    * **User Federation:** Integration with existing user directories like LDAP or Active Directory.
    * **Social Logins:** Built-in support for login with Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enhances security with minimal configuration.
    * **Advanced User and Role Management:** A full-featured admin console and API for managing
      users, groups, roles, and permissions.

* **Superior Security:** Authentication is a critical security component. Keycloak is an open-source
  project with a large community and dedicated security focus. It is rigorously tested and has
  established procedures for identifying and patching vulnerabilities. A custom-built service
  carries a much higher risk of containing subtle but critical security flaws.

* **Excellent Cloud-Native Integration:** Keycloak is designed to run in containerized, orchestrated
  environments like Kubernetes. It provides official Docker images and Helm charts for easy
  deployment. Its reliance on standard JWTs for tokens makes it trivial for the new Go microservices
  and any API Gateway to perform token validation, fitting perfectly into the target architecture.

* **Enforces Clean Separation of Concerns:** It allows the system to treat identity and access
  management as a separate, centralized concern. The application microservices are no longer
  responsible for how a user is authenticated; they only need to know *who* the user is and what
  they are *authorized to do* by validating a token. This aligns perfectly with microservice
  principles.

### Current State Analysis

The `auth-service` existing is a custom implementation built with Micronaut Security that handles 
basic authentication functionality:

- Simple username/password authentication against a database
- JWT token generation and validation
- Basic user profile management (login, avatar, product codes)
- Custom authentication provider logic

### Why Keycloak is the Right Choice

**1. Security and Compliance**

- Keycloak is a mature, battle-tested identity and access management solution with extensive
  security auditing
- Regular security updates and patches from Red Hat and the open-source community
- Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Comprehensive audit logging and compliance features

**2. Cloud-Native Architecture Alignment**

- Designed specifically for containerized, microservices environments
- Native Kubernetes support with official operators and Helm charts
- Follows 12-factor app principles with externalized configuration
- Horizontal scaling capabilities that align with the target Kubernetes-first deployment model

**3. Feature Richness Beyond Current Capabilities**

- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support out of the box
- Multifactor authentication (MFA) capabilities
- Social login integration (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple applications
- User federation with LDAP/Active Directory
- Fine-grained authorization policies and role-based access control (RBAC)

**4. Operational Simplicity**

- Eliminates the need to maintain custom authentication logic
- Reduces security-related development overhead
- Provides admin UI for user management, reducing operational burden
- Standard protocols mean easier integration with third-party tools and services

**5. Technology Stack Compatibility**

- Keycloak integrates seamlessly with Go microservices through standard JWT token validation
- Compatible with gRPC and REST APIs through standard Authorization headers
- Supports the target observability stack (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus metrics)
- Can be deployed alongside other cloud-native components in Kubernetes

**6. Migration Path Alignment**

- Replacing a custom Java service with a standard solution reduces the overall migration complexity
- Allows the team to focus Go development efforts on core business logic rather than authentication
  infrastructure
- Supports the strategic goal of leveraging proven, maintained solutions over custom implementations

**7. Scalability and Performance**

- Built for high-availability deployments with clustering support
- Optimized for performance in distributed systems
- Caching mechanisms for token validation to reduce database load
