## **1. Foundational & Shared Infrastructure**

- **Set up Go service skeletons** (repository structure, Docker images, CI/CD, observability, shared
  libraries).
- **Migrate or provision shared infrastructure**: gRPC gateway (or REST gateway), authentication
  patterns, event streaming (Kafka configs), and logging/tracing.

## **2. Low-Coupling, Low-Dependency Services**

**Migrate services that have fewer dependencies and are easier to test in isolation.**

### Candidates:

- **Chat Service:** Provides real-time messaging via WebSockets; interface is largely isolated.
- **Dashboard Service:** Reads from analytics DB; provides non-critical reporting, few write
  operations.

## **3. Core Building-Block Services (Read-Type)**

### Candidates:

- **Policy Search Service:** Consumes Kafka events, provides denormalized querying only. Can be
  migrated if events and APIs are respected.
- **Product Service:** After addressing product database migration (MongoDB → PostgreSQL+JSONB),
  update the service to Go.
    - This is a good initial candidate because its changes are mostly internal and can run side by
      side with Java version briefly, with staged switchover.

## **4. Supporting Services**

### Candidates:

- **Document Service:** Depends on policy events, product data, generates PDFs.
    - Can be migrated after downstream dependencies (products/search/events) are stable.

- **Pricing Service:** After moving pricing rules to new storage (e.g., Tarantool) and API, migrate
  service to Go.
    - Breaking up pricing rule sources early helps both pricing and document service work.

## **5. Core State-Changing/Orchestrating Services**

These are most complex, tightly coupled, and should be migrated after their dependencies are stable:

### Candidates:

- **Payment Service:** Relies on policy events, product/account data, and payment DB.
- **Policy Service:** The “heart” of the system; orchestrates policies, offers, pricing, event
  publishing.
    - Migrate last, as it depends on product/pricing/search/payment services, and breaking here
      disrupts the ecosystem.

## **6. Edge and Gateway**

- **Agent Portal Gateway:** Migrate to Go or a Go-compatible gateway (gRPC-Gateway/Envoy) last,
  after backend services are running in Go.
- **Auth Service:** Migrate in parallel or just before the gateway, ensuring compatibility with Go
  auth libraries (JWT, OAuth2, etc.).

## **7. Integration Testing & Switchover**

- Once all core services are migrated, test system-wide flows using Go versions only.
- Perform blue/green or canary deployments for “cutover” from Java/old stack to Go across all entry
  points.

## **Recommended Migration Sequence Table**

| Phase | Service                     | Prerequisites                                                |
|-------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Chat Service                | Go infra skeleton                                            |
| 2     | Dashboard Service           | Go infra skeleton, access to search DB                       |
| 3     | Policy Search Service       | Kafka events, search DB                                      |
| 3     | Product Service (+DB)       | Product DB migration, Go prod-service                        |
| 4     | Document Service (+storage) | Policy Search/Product Service, document storage, PDF utility |
| 4     | Pricing Service (+tariffs)  | Tariff rule storage migrated                                 |
| 5     | Payment Service             | Policy events/product service/payment DB                     |
| 5     | Policy Service              | Product, pricing, payment, and event infra                   |
| 6     | Agent Portal Gateway        | All backend Go services, Auth migrated                       |
| 6     | Auth Service                | Gateway/API compatibility                                    |

## **Summary**

- **Migrate least-dependent/read-only services first**.
- **Migrate product-service early**, especially after replacing MongoDB with PostgreSQL+JSONB.
- **Migrate pricing/document services after supporting infra/rules are switched**.
- **Migrate core write-heavy services (policy/payment) later**—they orchestrate other flows.
- **Migrate gateway/auth last**.

**This allows iterative, low-risk delivery, with frequent system-level testing at each stage.**

Based on the dependencies shown in the , the most logical and lowest-risk migration sequence from
Java to Go would follow the **Strangler Fig Pattern**. `insurance-hub-container-diagram.puml`
This means you will migrate one service at a time, routing traffic to the new Go service while the
old Java ecosystem remains operational. The key is to migrate services with the fewest outgoing
dependencies first.
Here is the recommended migration sequence, broken down into logical phases:

### **Migration Principles**

1. **Start with Foundational Services:** Migrate services that provide data or a specific function
   but do not depend on other internal microservices.
2. **Migrate Core Services Next:** Tackle the central services that orchestrate business logic by
   calling the foundational services.
3. **Migrate Downstream Services:** Services that react to events can be migrated once the
   event-producing services are stable.
4. **Migrate the Gateway Last:** The API Gateway is the entry point and will be responsible for
   routing traffic between the old Java services and the new Go services during the migration. Its
   full migration is the final step.

### **Recommended Migration Sequence**

#### **Phase 1: Foundational & Independent Services**

These services have no synchronous dependencies on other internal microservices, making them the
safest to migrate first.

1. **`product_service`**:
    - **Rationale**: It is a data provider called by but calls no other services. Migrating it first
      provides a stable source of product information for the next phase. `policy_service`
    - **Associated Task**: This is when you would also perform the data migration from MongoDB to
      PostgreSQL + JSONB.

2. **`pricing_service`**:
    - **Rationale**: Similar to the product service, it's a "leaf" node in the synchronous call
      chain. It only depends on an external storage for tariff rules.
    - **Associated Task**: This would involve migrating the MVEL script execution to the planned
      Tarantool solution.

3. **`auth_service`**:
    - **Rationale**: This is a critical but self-contained utility. It doesn't call other services
      and its function (token validation) is a well-defined, isolated concern.

#### **Phase 2: The Core Business Logic**

With the foundational services migrated, you can now tackle the central orchestrator.

1. **`policy_service`**:
    - **Rationale**: This service is the heart of the system. It depends on and , which are now
      stable Go services. Migrating it is the most critical step. `product_service``pricing_service`
    - **Associated Task**: The new Go must publish the `PolicyCreated` event to Kafka in the exact
      same format as the old Java service to ensure downstream services continue to function.
      `policy_service`

#### **Phase 3: Asynchronous & Downstream Consumers**

These services are primarily triggered by Kafka events. Once the new Go is publishing events, these
can be migrated, often in parallel. `policy_service`

1. **`payment_service`**, **`policy_search_service`**, **`document_service`**, **`dashboard_service`
   **:
    - **Rationale**: All four of these services are consumers of the `PolicyCreated` event. As long
      as the event schema in Kafka remains consistent, they can be migrated independently of each
      other.
    - **Associated Task**: Migrating the will also involve replacing the external `JSReport`
      dependency with the planned `chromedp` Go library. `document_service`

#### **Phase 4: Edge Services and Finalization**

These are the final pieces to complete the full migration.

1. **`chat_service`**:
    - **Rationale**: This service is highly isolated and only interacts with the gateway via
      WebSockets. It can be migrated at almost any point, but doing it here is safe as the core
      business functionality is already migrated.

2. **`gateway` (Agent Portal Gateway)**:
    - **Rationale**: This should be the last component to be fully migrated. Throughout the process,
      the gateway will be configured with routing rules (e.g., using a proxy like YARP or the
      built-in features of a new Go-based gateway) to direct requests to either the legacy Java
      services or the new Go services. Once all other services are migrated, the gateway can be
      fully switched over to a pure Go implementation (e.g., using gRPC-gateway) and the old routing
      rules can be removed.

### **Summary Table**

| Migration Order | Service Name            | Rationale                                                                          |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1               | `product_service`       | Foundational data provider; no internal dependencies.                              |
| 2               | `pricing_service`       | Foundational calculator; no internal dependencies.                                 |
| 3               | `auth_service`          | Self-contained utility.                                                            |
| 4               | **`policy_service`**    | **Core orchestrator**; depends on services from the previous phase.                |
| 5 (Parallel)    | `payment_service`       | Downstream event consumer.                                                         |
| 5 (Parallel)    | `policy_search_service` | Downstream event consumer.                                                         |
| 5 (Parallel)    | `document_service`      | Downstream event consumer.                                                         |
| 5 (Parallel)    | `dashboard_service`     | Downstream event consumer.                                                         |
| 6               | `chat_service`          | Isolated, specialized service.                                                     |
| 7               | `gateway`               | The final step; directs traffic during migration and is fully replaced at the end. |

Following this sequence will minimize risk, allow for incremental testing, and provide a smooth
transition from your Java to Go architecture.

# Claude

Based on the microservices architecture in your diagram, here's the appropriate migration sequence
from Java to Go, organized by dependency layers and risk management:

## **Migration Sequence Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Services (Low Risk, High Impact)**

**Order: 1-2 weeks each**

1. **Auth Service**
    - **Why First**: All other services depend on JWT validation
    - **Low Risk**: Simple, stateless service with clear boundaries
    - **High Impact**: Establishes Go authentication patterns for other services

2. **Product Service**
    - **Why Second**: No downstream dependencies, only upstream consumers
    - **Migration Bonus**: Perfect time to migrate MongoDB → PostgreSQL+JSONB
    - **Stable Interface**: Product catalog changes infrequently

### **Phase 2: Supporting Services (Medium Risk)**

**Order: 2-3 weeks each**

3. **Pricing Service**
    - **Why Third**: Only consumed by Policy Service, no downstream dependencies
    - **Complex Logic**: Tariff rules need careful migration (good candidate for Tarantool
      migration)
    - **Isolated**: Can be thoroughly tested before Policy Service migration

4. **Payment Service**
    - **Why Fourth**: Consumed by Policy Service but relatively independent
    - **File I/O**: Bank statement processing needs careful handling
    - **Event Consumer**: Already handles Kafka events, pattern established

### **Phase 3: Data Services (Medium Risk)**

**Order: 2-3 weeks each**

5. **Policy Search Service**
    - **Why Fifth**: Pure event consumer, no synchronous dependencies
    - **Elasticsearch**: Go client well-established
    - **Read-Only**: Only builds search indexes from events

6. **Dashboard Service**
    - **Why Sixth**: Similar to Policy Search - pure event consumer
    - **Analytics**: Can be migrated and tested independently
    - **Non-Critical**: System functions without real-time analytics

### **Phase 4: Document Services (Higher Risk)**

**Order: 3-4 weeks each**

7. **Document Service**
    - **Why Seventh**: Complex external dependencies (JSReport)
    - **Migration Opportunity**: Perfect time to replace JSReport with chromedp
    - **Event-Driven**: Processes PolicyCreated events

8. **Chat Service**
    - **Why Eighth**: WebSocket complexity, real-time requirements
    - **Isolated**: Doesn't affect core business logic
    - **Non-Critical**: System functions without chat

### **Phase 5: Core Business Logic (Highest Risk)**

**Order: 4-6 weeks**

9. **Policy Service**
    - **Why Last**: Most complex, central to all business flows
    - **High Risk**: Core business logic, CQRS implementation
    - **Dependencies**: By now, all services it calls are already migrated
    - **Event Publisher**: Most complex Kafka event publishing logic

10. **Agent Portal Gateway**
    - **Why Final**: Depends on all other services being migrated
    - **Low Risk**: Mostly routing logic, but needs all services working
    - **Critical**: Last piece to complete migration

---

## **Risk Mitigation Strategy**

### **Parallel Migration Approach**

- **Weeks 1-2**: Auth + Product (can run in parallel)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Pricing + Payment (can run in parallel)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Policy Search + Dashboard (can run in parallel)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Document + Chat (can run in parallel)
- **Weeks 9-12**: Policy Service (requires full focus)
- **Weeks 13-14**: Gateway (final integration)

### **Rollback Strategy**

- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Keep Java versions running alongside Go versions
- **Feature Flags**: Route traffic gradually to Go services
- **Database Compatibility**: Ensure Go services can read Java-written data
- **Monitoring**: Extensive monitoring during transition period

### **Testing Strategy**

- **Contract Testing**: Ensure API compatibility between Java and Go versions
- **Integration Testing**: Test cross-service communication early
- **Load Testing**: Verify Go services can handle production traffic
- **End-to-End Testing**: Full workflow testing with mixed Java/Go services

---

## **Key Dependencies to Watch**

1. **JWT Token Compatibility**: Auth Service migration must maintain token format
2. **Kafka Message Schemas**: Event compatibility between Java and Go publishers/consumers
3. **Database Schema**: Ensure Go services can read/write existing data
4. **API Contracts**: Maintain HTTP API compatibility during transition
5. **Configuration**: Service discovery and configuration management

---

## **Migration Benefits by Phase**

- **Phase 1**: Immediate security and data layer improvements
- **Phase 2**: Business logic performance gains
- **Phase 3**: Search and analytics performance improvements
- **Phase 4**: Document generation simplification and performance
- **Phase 5**: Complete system performance and maintainability gains

This sequence minimizes risk while maximizing the ability to test and validate each service
independently before moving to the next phase.
