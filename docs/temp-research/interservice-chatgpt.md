Yes, your approach is **sensible and widely used** in modern microservice system design. Here’s why:

### **Why Your Approach Is Sound**

1. **Optimized Inter-Service Communication**
    - Using **gRPC for service-to-service calls** provides strong typing, efficient binary
      serialization, and support for streaming. This is ideal for internal, high-performance
      communication between microservices.

2. **Clean Exposure to External Clients**
    - For services that must be consumable by external actors (such as browsers, mobile apps, or
      third parties), exposing them **through HTTP/JSON via grpc-gateway** is a robust choice.
    - With grpc-gateway, you can offer a familiar REST/JSON or OpenAPI interface to those clients,
      while maintaining your gRPC contracts for internal development.

3. **Single Definition of API**
    - By defining API contracts in `.proto` files, you maintain a single source of truth for both
      your HTTP and gRPC endpoints. This simplifies development and reduces duplication or drift
      between different API surfaces.

4. **API Gateway as a Control Point**
    - Routing all external requests through an API gateway allows centralized handling of
      cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, rate limiting, logging, and monitoring.
    - The API gateway can receive HTTP calls and route them to the grpc-gateway reverse-proxy, which
      then translates and forwards them as gRPC calls to the appropriate microservice.

### **Typical Flow**

```
External Client (HTTP/JSON)
    └──> API Gateway (HTTP)
           └──> grpc-gateway (HTTP to gRPC)
                  └──> gRPC Service

Internal Microservices
    └──> Direct gRPC calls between each other
```

---

### **Benefits**

- **Performance:** Internal gRPC is much faster than REST/JSON for large, high-volume systems.
- **Standardization:** Exposing REST/OpenAPI endpoints makes integration easy for third-party or
  frontend clients.
- **Maintainability:** Having APIs defined in Protocol Buffers means less code duplication and
  cleaner versioning.
- **Security:** API Gateway provides a single point for implementing external access control.

**In summary:**  
Your approach is aligned with best practices for scalable, secure, and maintainable microservice
systems. If you have follow-up questions or need tips on implementing any piece of this (such as
error mapping, authentication, or versioning), I’m happy to help!
