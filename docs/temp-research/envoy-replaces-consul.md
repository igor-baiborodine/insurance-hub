## Current State

The `agent-portal-gateway` is currently a Java-based Micronaut service that serves as the entry
point for agent portal interactions. It handles HTTP requests, routing, and basic authentication
validation within the existing non-cloud-native deployment environment. The current implementation
lacks advanced traffic management capabilities and relies on limited observability infrastructure.

## Why Envoy Proxy is the Right Choice

**Cloud-Native Standard**: Envoy is the industry-standard proxy for cloud-native architectures,
serving as the foundation for major service mesh solutions like Istio and Linkerd. This ensures
long-term support and ecosystem compatibility.

**Performance**: Built in C++, Envoy significantly outperforms Java-based gateways in memory usage,
CPU efficiency, and request throughput, aligning with the target state's emphasis on resource
efficiency.

**Advanced Features**: Envoy provides enterprise-grade capabilities out-of-the-box including load
balancing, circuit breaking, retries, canary deployments, and sophisticated traffic
management—eliminating the need for custom implementation.

**Protocol Support**: Native support for both HTTP/REST and gRPC protocols perfectly matches the
target architecture's dual communication strategy (gRPC internally, REST at the edge).

**Observability Integration**: Built-in integration with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and distributed
tracing systems directly supports the comprehensive observability goals without additional
configuration overhead.

**Security and Policy**: Robust security features including TLS termination, JWT validation, rate
limiting, and integration with external auth services support the zero-trust security model.

**Dynamic Configuration**: Runtime configuration updates through xDS APIs enable GitOps-style
management and seamless Kubernetes integration without service restarts.

Replacing the custom gateway with Envoy reduces operational complexity, improves performance, and
provides enterprise-grade features that would require significant development effort to implement,
allowing the team to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns.

That's an excellent and insightful question. The relationship between Envoy, Consul, and Kubernetes
is a key aspect of cloud-native architecture.
Based on the migration to a Kubernetes-native environment, the short answer is:
**Yes, in a standard Kubernetes deployment, the use of Envoy Proxy combined with Kubernetes's native
capabilities eliminates the need for Consul's primary function—service discovery.**
Here is a more detailed breakdown of the reasoning to add to your documentation.

### Confirmation: Envoy and Kubernetes Supersede Consul for Service Discovery

In the context of the proposed migration to Go and Kubernetes, using Envoy as the API
Gateway/Ingress Controller replaces the , and **Kubernetes itself replaces the core functionalities
of Consul**. `agent-portal-gateway`

#### How Kubernetes Natively Replaces Consul's Core Functions

Consul is primarily used for three things:

1. **Service Discovery:** Telling services where to find other services.
2. **Health Checking:** Monitoring service health and removing unhealthy instances.
3. **Key-Value (KV) Store:** Storing configuration data.

Kubernetes provides built-in, first-class solutions for all of these:

- **Service Discovery (Replaces Consul Service Registry):**
    - When you deploy a Go microservice (e.g., ) in Kubernetes, you also create a `Service` object.
      `auth-service`
    - Kubernetes gives this `Service` a stable, internal DNS name (e.g.,
      `auth-service.default.svc.cluster.local`).
    - All other pods in the cluster can simply use this DNS name to communicate with the .
      Kubernetes's internal DNS (CoreDNS) automatically resolves this name to a stable IP address
      and load-balances requests across all healthy pods for that service. `auth-service`
    - This DNS-based discovery is the standard, idiomatic way to handle service-to-service
      communication within Kubernetes, making Consul's service registry redundant.

- **Health Checking (Replaces Consul Health Checks):**
    - Kubernetes uses **liveness and readiness probes**.
    - **Readiness Probes** tell the `Service` object when a pod is ready to accept traffic. If a
      probe fails, Kubernetes stops sending traffic to that pod but leaves it running.
    - **Liveness Probes** check if a pod is still functioning. If it fails, Kubernetes automatically
      restarts the container.
    - This robust health-checking mechanism is built into the orchestrator and is more tightly
      integrated than an external system like Consul.

- **Configuration (Replaces Consul KV Store):**
    - Kubernetes provides `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets` for managing application configuration and
      sensitive data, respectively. This is the standard way to inject configuration into your Go
      applications running in the cluster.

#### The Role of Envoy in This New Architecture

Envoy does not discover services by itself. It is a data plane proxy that needs to be _told_ where
to send traffic by a **control plane**.

- When used as an **Ingress/API Gateway** in Kubernetes, Envoy's control plane (like Contour,
  Emissary-ingress, or another Ingress Controller) watches the Kubernetes API. When a new `Service`
  is created or a pod's status changes, the control plane automatically reconfigures Envoy to route
  traffic to the correct, healthy internal DNS names.
- This means **Envoy leverages Kubernetes's native service discovery**; it does not need Consul to
  find the backend services.

#### Conclusion: Why Consul is No Longer Needed

For a pure Kubernetes environment, introducing Consul adds unnecessary complexity and an extra
component to manage without providing significant benefits over what the platform already offers.
The combination of:

1. **Kubernetes:** For service discovery, health checking, and configuration.
2. **Envoy:** As the high-performance data plane for handling traffic, configured by a K8s-aware
   control plane.

...creates a complete, robust, and idiomatic cloud-native architecture. Therefore, you can
confidently state that **Consul can be decommissioned as part of the migration to Kubernetes.**

> **Caveat**: The only scenario where you might keep Consul is in a **hybrid environment**, where
> some services run inside Kubernetes and others run on VMs or in a different cloud. In that case,
> Consul can act as a bridge, providing a single service discovery plane across both environments.
> However, for a system being fully migrated into Kubernetes, this is not a concern.
