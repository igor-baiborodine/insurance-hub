Yes, your proposed approach is not only sensible and sound but is also considered a **modern best
practice** for designing and exposing Go-based microservice systems. It effectively combines the
performance and rigor of GRPC for internal communication with the universal compatibility of
HTTP/REST for external clients.

This architectural pattern is widely adopted because it leverages the best of both worlds.

### Why This is a Strong Architectural Choice

1. **Optimal Protocol for the Job**:
    * **Internal (GRPC)**: You are using a high-performance, strongly-typed RPC framework designed
      for efficient, low-latency communication between services. The use of Protocol Buffers ensures
      a strict, evolvable contract between your microservices.
    * **External (HTTP/JSON)**: You are exposing a standard, easy-to-consume RESTful API for
      external actors (like web front-ends, mobile apps, or third-party integrators), which is the
      lingua franca of the web.

2. **Single Source of Truth for APIs**:
    * With `grpc-gateway`, your API is defined **only once** in your `.proto` files. From this
      single definition, you generate:
        * The GRPC server and client stubs for internal communication.
        * The HTTP reverse-proxy handlers.
        * OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation for your external consumers.
    * This eliminates API drift and ensures your GRPC and HTTP interfaces are always in sync, which
      is a massive boost for maintainability.

3. **Clean Separation of Concerns**:
    * Your core business logic in your microservices remains pure and focused on GRPC. The services
      don't need to be polluted with HTTP-specific concerns like JSON marshaling, multiplexing, or
      RESTful routing.
    * The `grpc-gateway` acts as a dedicated translation layer.
    * The API Gateway handles all the cross-cutting "edge" concerns like authentication, rate
      limiting, CORS, and logging in a single place.

### The Flow is Clean and Logical

* **External Traffic**: `External Client` -> `API Gateway (HTTP)` ->
  `grpc-gateway (HTTP to GRPC)` -> `GRPC Service`
* **Internal Traffic**: `GRPC Service A` -> `GRPC Service B`

This clear distinction makes the system easier to understand, manage, and secure.

### Conclusion

Your approach is excellent. You are building a robust, maintainable, and scalable system that aligns
with industry-standard patterns used by many leading tech companies. It provides the performance
benefits of a binary protocol internally while not sacrificing the accessibility of a standard web
API externally. You can proceed with confidence that this is a sound and well-reasoned architectural
decision.
